Members: Sam Bolig, Jeffrey Ho, Antara Mondal, Aijin Wang

Advised by: [Sam Ventura](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/people/faculty/sam-ventura)

### Objective
To predict injury recurrence in the NHL through means of survival analysis and multi-state modeling

### Running Code
Penguins-Research-Project.rmd contains source code that takes player data and filters/cleans it; it also contains code snippets used for multi-state-model analysis. Simply change the directory that each dataset is imported from to your own local directory in order to utilize on your local machine.. 



* Note: Continuous work will be done on this project throughout the Spring 2018 semester
